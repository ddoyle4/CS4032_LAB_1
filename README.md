Submission for Sockets 1 - To implement a simple echo client using raw sockets.

Author: David Doyle

#### Compiling
Compile with `ghc -o client Main.hs`

### Running
Run with `./client`


**Note**
The built-in php server can sometimes give me trouble. I have tested the client against the same script, /server/index.php, when it's running on a proper apache server and it works perfectly.
